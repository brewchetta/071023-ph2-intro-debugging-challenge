# Phase 2 React Debugging Challenge

This is an introductory debugging challenge to test your knowledge of React. You'll spend the majority of your time on this assignment debugging the code to make it work.

Once everything is working, there are some additional deliverables to complete including a bonus.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone the repository and open it with your editor. Run `npm install` in the repository followed by `npm start` in order to see the initial error messages.

You will only need to work with the files in `src`, the `package.json` and `public` files should work already.
